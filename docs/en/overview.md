# UniProton User Guide

## Introduction

UniProton is an operating system (OS) for embedded scenarios provided by the openEuler community. It aims to build a high-quality OS platform that shields underlying hardware differences for upper-layer service software and provides powerful debugging functions. UniProton allows service software to be quickly ported to different hardware platforms, facilitates chip selection, and reduces costs for hardware procurement and software maintenance.

This document describes the basic functions and APIs of UniProton.
